Steps to setup this project:

Step 1: Clone this repo and pip install requirements.txt
Step 2: Download pgAdmin https://www.pgadmin.org/download/ and create your Postgres database
Step 3: Add your database credentials info to config.py
Step 4: In display_aqi_for_city_and_date.py, run "await add_test_data()" to load sample AQI data to your Postgres database the first time you run your app
Step 5: In all other instances, run "run app.run(port=8000, debug=True)" (also in display_aqi_for_city_and_date.py)
Step 6: Navigate over to your localhost (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000) and interact with the app as you please
Step 7: If you'd like to download additional historical AQI data you can do so over at https://aqicn.org/data-platform/register/


Purpose of this project:

To build the "Time travel Machine - for seeing the air quality at any day back in time" mentioned here: https://aqicn.org/contribute/.

Future developments:
1. Error handling
2. Check for and fetch new data for target sensor cities
3. Cache most popular user queries  
4. Show historical mean and median for all available particulate types in user query
5. Show pie chart with AQI classification frequency
6. Allow user who may not know exact sensor station name to search by city to find station name
